I present a exemple of a Multilayer Percepton Neural Net.
There are four datasets on the directory:
1) Logic gate OR
2) Logic gate AND
3) Logic gate XOR
4) Caracteres
	4.1. Limpo (Clean)
	4.2. Ruido (Noise)
	4.2. Ruido-2 (Noise 2)
The first three datasets were implemented for some testing before implementing the neural net for character identification.

On the logic gate problems, the last column on the dataset is the data label and all the others are features. On the character dataset, the last 7 columns represents a character, while all the others are features.
